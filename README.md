## Overview
This project presents a stochastic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic model that incorporates spatial movement, random interactions, and reflective boundaries to simulate how infectious diseases spread through a population. Instead of relying solely on standard deterministic curves, this model demonstrates how randomness introduces natural variability that mirrors real-world epidemics more accurately.

## Mathematical & Biological Context
The population is divided into three distinct, non-overlapping states:
* **Susceptible (S):** Healthy individuals who can become infected.
* **Infected (I):** Individuals who currently carry the disease and can transmit it to others.
* **Recovered (R):** Individuals who have recovered and are assumed to have permanent immunity.

The classic deterministic model uses the following differential equations governed by an infection rate (β) and recovery rate (γ):

dS/dt = -βSI
dI/dt = βSI - γI
dR/dt = γI

However, this project implements the spread stochastically using probabilities. It uses the binomial distribution to model infection as a "trial" with a probability of success upon contact, capturing individual-level uncertainty and producing a range of outcomes even under identical initial conditions.

## Spatial Dynamics & Agent Movement
Agent movement in the model follows a 2D random walk, stepping in random directions over time to approximate how people move unpredictably in real environments. The model incorporates principles of Brownian motion and uses a diffusion coefficient to calculate step sizes consistent with a physical system.

## Repository Structure
This project uses a modular design to separate the underlying logic from the execution:
* `SIR_model.py`: The main module containing the main class. It handles the initialization of spatial bounds, the random walk logic (calculating random steps and boundary reflections), and the binomial infection phase.
* `ProjectRun.py`: The execution script. It imports the model, sets the initial parameters (such as population size N=10000, grid length L=100, and time steps), and triggers the simulation.
* `requirements.txt`: Required Python libraries for running the simulation.

## Real-Time Visualization
A major feature of this module is its live animation. The program displays a real-time spatial map showing agents as colored dots: susceptible (blue), infected (red), and recovered (green). A secondary graph dynamically tracks the S, I, and R curves over time, allowing for a direct visual comparison between the thick lines of the classic ODE model and the thin lines generated by the 2D agent-based random walk.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Execute the main run script to launch the live animation:
   python ProjectRun.py
